How do parasites survive hostile environmental conditions? 

Certain parasites such as coccidia can exist in soil, water, and food as a egg-like form called the oocyst. It typically ranges from 10 to 40 Âµm in size and harbours two sets of extracellular walls. By using quantitative imaging and biophysical approaches, we explore how these walls helps the parasites to survive harsh environmental transmission and infect their hosts.
