How do parasites survive hostile environmental conditions? 

Certain parasites such as coccidia can exist in soil, water, and food as a egg-like form called the oocyst. It typically ranges from 10 to 40 µm in size and harbours two sets of multilayered walls that face external physical and chemical factors that are usually detrimental to other eukaryotic cell types. Our research develops quantitative imaging and biophysical approaches to explore how the oocyst walls help the parasites to survive harsh environmental conditions and infect their hosts. 

Mechanics and adhesion properties of the oocyst wall

Forces required for processing the oocyst wall


Response of coccidia to food and water decontamination treatments
By using the imaging and biophysical tools we are developing or adpating to the parasites (see above), we study the response of coccidia to common household and industrial inactivation treatments including chlorination and ozone. We explore the effects of such treatments on the structure, permeability, and mechanics of their walls, and in collaboration with parasitologists and 'omics' experts, we investigate whether treatments modify the oocyst transcriptome, proteome, and infectivity. To this aim, we contribute to develop alternative approaches to assess the infectivity of native vs. treated parasites by using cell culture coupled to qPCR and surrogate models. In particular, we aim at determining whether oocysts of the chicken E. acervulina and mouse E. papillata, which are produced more easily than T. gondii oocysts, can be used as non pathogenic surrogate models of T. gondii to assess the efficacy of physical and chemical decontamination treatments.
