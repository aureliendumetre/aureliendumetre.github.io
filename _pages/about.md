We use quantitative imaging and biophysical approaches to study how coccidian parasites survive environmental conditions and common inactivation methods to infect animals and humans. Our main models are *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Eimeria* spp. 


Probing the structure, mechanics, and surface adhesion of the oocyst walls

Coccidian parasites can exist in soils, waters, and foods as an egg-like form called the oocyst. It contains infectious parasites surrounded by multilayered walls. We study how the structure and mechanics of these walls help the parasites to survive harsh environmental conditions. To this aim, we develop or adapt single-cell force measurement techniques coupled to imaging, such as atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, and micropipette aspiration techniques, to characterize (i) the mechanics of the walls submitted to various chemical and physical factors and the forces required for deforming or breaking them, and (ii) the nature and duration of adhesion forces at the wall surface, which seem to drive the retention or circulation of the oocysts throughout different environments. 
We also take advantage of these macromanipulation techniques and of the ability of phagocytic cells such like macrophages to interact with oocysts to characterize the forces the phagocytes exert to adhere, fold, and open the oocyst walls. 

 
Response of coccidian parasites to food and water decontamination treatments

We study the response of coccidia to common household and industrial inactivation treatments including chlorination and ozone. We investigate the effects of such treatments on the structure, permeability, and mechanics of their walls, and in collaboration with parasitologists and 'omics' experts, we explore whether treatments modify the oocyst transcriptome, proteome, and infectivity. To this purpose, we contribute to develop alternative approaches to assess the infectivity of native vs. treated parasites by using cell culture coupled to qPCR and surrogate models. In particular, we aim at determining whether oocysts of the chicken *E. acervulina* and mouse *E. papillata*, which are produced more easily than *T. gondii* oocysts, can be used as non pathogenic surrogate models of *T. gondii* to assess the efficacy of physical and chemical decontamination treatments.
