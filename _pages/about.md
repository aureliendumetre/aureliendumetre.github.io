How do coccidian parasites survive harsh conditions?
Coccidian parasites can contaminate soils, waters, and food as a egg-like form called the oocyst. It typically ranges from 10 to 40 µm in size and harbours two sets of multilayered walls that face external physical and chemical factors that are usually detrimental to other eukaryotic cell types. By using quantitative imaging and biophysical approaches on the coccidian models *Eimeria*, we explore how the walls help the parasites to survive harsh environmental conditions and infect their hosts. 

The oocyst wall as a key structure that determines the transmission of and infectivity by coccidian parasites
We use Eimeria parasites as coccidian models to develop innovative single-cell force measurement techniques coupled to imaging to provide a quantitative characterization of the biophysical properties of the walls of oocysts exposed to treatments. A first objective is to develop atomic force microscopy and micromanipulation techniques coupled to fluorescence microscopy to characterize (i) the mechanics of the walls of untreated oocysts and the forces required for deforming or breaking them, and (ii) the nature and duration of adhesion forces at the wall surface. A second objective is to apply these techniques to characterize the resistance of the walls of oocysts exposed to ozone disinfection and osmotic stress conditions and link it to the parasite infectivity. We believe that the new data and methodologies generated by this project will provide a quantitative description of the key biophysical parameters of the oocyst wall that determine the behaviour and infectivity of coccidian parasites exposed to adverse conditions.

How to tackle the transmission of coccidia?

Response of coccidia to food and water decontamination treatments
We study the response of coccidia to common household and industrial inactivation treatments including chlorination and ozone. We explore the effects of such treatments on the structure, permeability, and mechanics of their walls, and in collaboration with parasitologists and 'omics' experts, we investigate whether treatments modify the oocyst transcriptome, proteome, and infectivity. To this aim, we contribute to develop alternative approaches to assess the infectivity of native vs. treated parasites by using cell culture coupled to qPCR and surrogate models. In particular, we aim at determining whether oocysts of the chicken *E. acervulina* and mouse *E. papillata*, which are produced more easily than *T. gondii* oocysts, can be used as non pathogenic surrogate models of T. gondii to assess the efficacy of physical and chemical decontamination treatments.
